# Knowledge Base ðŸ“š

This document serves as a living knowledge base for the PWA Note Taking App project, documenting important learnings, best practices, and technical decisions.

## Project Setup

### Initial Setup Decisions
- Using vanilla JavaScript for better performance and smaller bundle size
- Implementing PWA features from scratch for better understanding and control
- Using Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling approach

### PWA Best Practices
- Implementing service workers for offline functionality
- Using IndexedDB for local storage
- Implementing app shell architecture
- Setting up proper caching strategies

### Performance Considerations
- Code splitting for better initial load time
- Lazy loading of non-critical components
- Implementing proper caching strategies
- Using compression for assets

### Security Measures
- Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Using HTTPS
- Securing stored data
- Implementing proper CORS policies

## Technical Documentation

This section will be updated as we implement various features and learn new things during development.

### Current Learnings
- Repository structure best practices
- Documentation standards
- Project planning and organization

### To Be Documented
- Voice dictation implementation
- IndexedDB usage patterns
- Service worker strategies
- Push notification setup
- Offline functionality implementation
